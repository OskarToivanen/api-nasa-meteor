This app was created using several technologies and tools, including:

React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that provides static typing to help catch errors early in the development process.

MaterialUI: a React UI framework that provides pre-built components and styles to make it easier to create visually appealing and responsive web applications.

Express: a popular Node.js framework for building server-side applications.

Axios: a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from the client to the server.

NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service API: an API that provides data about potentially hazardous asteroids that have made close approaches to Earth.
Together, these technologies and tools were used to build a web application that allows users to retrieve information about potentially hazardous asteroids using a user interface built with React and MaterialUI, and a server-side application built with Express and Axios to retrieve data from NASA's API. TypeScript was used to add static typing to the codebase, helping catch errors early in the development process.
